# Mancala
This is a CLI to play Mancala. There are different rules out there but this version of the game has the following rules:

# Rules of the game
The goal of the game is to get more marbles in your own mancala than your opponent.
1. The board has six holes on each player's side. On the right side of the player's holes is their mancala.
2. A player can chose a hole. All marbles from that hole are picked up and one marble is dropped in each of the next holes or the player's own mancala going counter-clockwise until all the picked up marbles are spent
3. The opponent's mancala is skipped.
4. If the last marble was dropped in the player's mancala, they can go again.
5. If the last marble was dropped in an empty hole, it's the opponents turn.
6. The game ends, if one of the players has the majority of the marbles in their mancala or if one of the players has no holes left with marbles and it is their turn.

Happy playing :)
